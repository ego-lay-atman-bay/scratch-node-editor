Here's what each input is for (options with * are not required)

- pos: The (x, y) of the node
  - values
    1. The x-position of the node (must be a number)
	2. the y-position of the node (must be a number)
	- Default value: (0, 0)
- id: The id of the node
  - value
    - The id of the node. (any text)
- title: The title of the node
  - value
    - The title of the node (top text). (any text)
- inputs/outputs: The inputs/outputs of the node
  - value
    Each input/output is separated by a semi-colon (;), and you can set an input/output type by putting it in brakets. For example
	[code]
	input-1;editable input[edit]
    [/code]
	Makes 2 inputs/outputs, the first one, nothing special.
	The second one is an input you can edit.
	
	You can also use curly brackets {} to make a default value. For example,
	[code]
	input-1[edit]{default}
	[/code]
	Makes an editable input that has the default value of "default".
	
	Scroll down for a list of input/output types.
