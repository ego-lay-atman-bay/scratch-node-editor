-Thanks to @-Rex- for Stamp Font Engine ++
-I used the Work Sans https://weiweihuanghuang.github.io/Work-Sans/ font created by Wei Huang
-Thanks to windows 10 for the normal, hand, move and beam cursors (names of the costumes). 
-I traced the grab and drag ones myself, using refrence images though (couldn't find them in windows).
-The whole node editor engine was made completely by me.

I made the whole Node Editor in one sprite so people can just backpack it, and import it into their own projects. Please give credit if used. (not sure if anyone would even use it since the sprite has over 7,000 blocks...)
